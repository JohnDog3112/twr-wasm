This example demos 6 simultaneous consoles. 2 div as streams, 2 canvas as terminals, and 2 canvas as 2D draw surfaces.

* [Source for multi-io](https://github.com/twiddlingbits/twr-wasm/tree/main/examples/multi-io) 

The multi-io example demonstrates:

* Creating consoles in JavaScript/TypeScript
* Using consoles in C/C++ and JavaScript/TypeScript
* Mixing multiple Consoles
* Inputting, printing, and drawing to consoles

This example is useful in understanding [Consoles with C/C++ WebAssembly: stdio, stderr, and more](./../gettingstarted/stdio.md)
